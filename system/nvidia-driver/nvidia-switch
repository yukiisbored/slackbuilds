# nvidia-switch utility 4.5
#
# A tool to install and cleanly remove the nvidia driver without stomping on the xorg files.
# Note: this tool "should" allow switching on the fly, but why? Pick a driver! You will still
# need to edit a bunch of other config files.

# TO-DO: needs more cleanup, simplify linking using system tools, add 15.0 fixes
